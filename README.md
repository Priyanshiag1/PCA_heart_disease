# PCA on Heart Disease Dataset 🫀

This project demonstrates the use of **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** — a powerful unsupervised learning technique — applied to the Heart Disease dataset. PCA is used here for **dimensionality reduction**, followed by a supervised model to perform prediction.

## 🔍 Objective
- Apply PCA to reduce the number of features in the dataset.
- Analyze variance explained by principal components.
- Use transformed data to build a predictive model for heart disease presence.

## 📚 Key Concepts Covered

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Variance Explained by Components
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Data Visualization
- Supervised Learning (for final prediction)

## 🧠 Why it's part of **Unsupervised Learning**

Although the final task is a supervised classification problem, PCA is an **unsupervised technique** used for:
- Exploring high-dimensional data
- Identifying patterns and redundancies
- Visualizing data in 2D/3D
- Preprocessing and improving model efficiency

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib / seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

- Performance comparison of model with and without PCA
  - Note: The model's accuracy slightly decreased after PCA, highlighting that dimensionality reduction doesn’t always improve supervised performance. However, it remains a powerful tool for visualization and preprocessing.
